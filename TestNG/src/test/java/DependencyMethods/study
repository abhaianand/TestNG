in testing if any one of the test case fail all the test case associated with the

dependancy
-------------

but in test ng if we dont define dependency all he @test will execute even if the main test case faill, so we need to impliment dependencymethod  in test case
so if the dependancy case fail all the case associated with the case skipp which will reduce the time of execuation

***dependsOnMethods={",ethodname1","method2","methodname3"}****
