what is listener

from test result if you want to perform some action we use listeners
Testng interface - Itest listeners , on test success,on test pass, on test fail
listener class is for post execution action
there are 2 ways to implement listener class
-----------------------------------------------
method 1
class mylistner implements ITestlistner{ //itest listner is interface
}
method 2
class mylistner extends TestlistnerAdapter{ //testlistneradapter is a class
}
--> if you choose second method , extends the class, you have to over ride the methods which inside the parent class
--> if you choose method 1 , just interface , you can call the methode and write the code you want inside it , and it will execute
 --->listner can run through the class and run through the xml , if you run through the xml after suite write listner tag
 ----> if you use the listner in test case class you have to use the listern in every est case class which ned more effort , but instead of that a single linke code in xml after suite will give you the
 same result
 ---> listner can write in a separate class it wll automaticall call all the methods durin execution , like before test start, during test fail, during test pass, during test skip, after text execution etc...
---> by using lsitern we can customise the report of testing using 3rd party extend report methods
-->onTestStart,onTestSuccess,onTestFailure,onTestSkipped,onStart,onFinish
on start- before starting all the test case

EXTEND REPORT
---------------
3rd party dependency maven
-- extends report using listner class
    public ExtentSparkReporter sparkreport; //UI of the report
    public ExtentReports extent; // common project information
    public ExtentTest test;//creating test case entry and update status of the test methods
    on finish is must otherwise the report not generated
