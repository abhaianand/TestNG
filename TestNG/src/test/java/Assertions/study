assertion is for verify the test case , by compare the actual and expected output
even if we have if else condition , it will return the code statement as true or flase , but in testng report it shows as pass ,
inorder to make test case status as failed in testng report we go fore assertion

we have two type of assertion

Hard assertion and Soft assertion
asser.equals,assert.notequal,assert.true,assert.false, assert.fail(always fail)

1 Hard assertion
-------------------
Every line of code after assertion will be terminated if the assertion fails
Mostly use in automation
Hard assertion you can call by direct class , becose it is a Static class

2 Soft assertion
------------------
Even if the assert fail all the code after the assertion will continue its execution
Soft assertion you can to call by creating the object of softasser class
because it is not static

in soft assert you have to create object and asl you have to do object.assertAll();  , otherwise it will show pass in test result even if the asser fails
